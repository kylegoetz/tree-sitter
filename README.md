Tree-sitter is a parser generator tool and an incremental parsing library. It can build a concrete syntax tree for a source file and efficiently update the syntax tree as the source file is edited. Tree-sitter aims to be:

- **General** enough to parse any programming language
- **Fast** enough to parse on every keystroke in a text editor
- **Robust** enough to provide useful results even in the presence of syntax errors
- **Dependency-free** so that the runtime library (which is written in pure C) can be embedded in any application

This repo is a fork I made to create friendly HTML reports, and then I was asked to instead generate JSON, so I rewrote to generate JSON instead, but in the end, the code wasn't needed for the main project. But I still find it useful, so this is mainly going to exist for me to pull upstream TS changes into my personal fork that has the JSON code, which I plan to convert back into HTML-report generating code.

Anyone else is welcome to use this, but I don't plan on providing support or binaries.
